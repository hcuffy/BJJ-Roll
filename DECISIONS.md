# Decisions

Architecture and tooling decisions for BJJ-Roll. Each entry records the decision, the rejected alternative (where there is one), the date, who decided, and the consequences.

Version bumps (Postgres image, Python) are recorded here and in the PR that makes them.

## A1: Job queue is pg-boss

- **Decision:** Use pg-boss for the job queue.
- **Rejected alternative:** A hand-written `SKIP LOCKED` job table.
- **Date:** 2026-10-17
- **Decided by:** Henry
- **Consequences:** The Hono ↔ Python worker job contract (HEN-41) builds on pg-boss. Known risk: Python workers claiming pg-boss jobs over SQL is untested; HEN-41 and the queue work verify it.

## A2: Postgres test container is Testcontainers

- **Decision:** Use Testcontainers (`@testcontainers/postgresql`) for Postgres in tests. The image is pinned exactly to `postgres:18.6`.
- **Date:** 2026-10-17
- **Decided by:** Henry
- **Consequences:** Used by HEN-55 (Vitest per package + Postgres test container).

## A3: Python lint and test for `packages/workers` is Ruff + pytest

- **Decision:** Use Ruff for lint and pytest for tests in `packages/workers`.
- **Python:** Pinned exactly to `3.15.0` (`.python-version`). Dependencies are managed with uv, with a committed `uv.lock`.
- **Style:** Python uses 4-space indent (PEP 8, Ruff default). The 2-space rule applies to JS/TS only.
- **Test files:** Named `test_<module>_<scenario>.py`.
- **Date:** 2026-10-17
- **Decided by:** Henry
- **Consequences:** Used by HEN-56 (Python worker lint and test).

## D22: Owner can see their own footage unmasked

- **Decision:** Owner can see their own footage unmasked.
- **Date:** 2026-10-17
- **Decided by:** Henry
- **Consequences:** The label set stays open under HEN-44.
